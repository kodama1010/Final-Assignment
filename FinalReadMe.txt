Changes made to game:
I made two total changes to final game. The minor one was adding a speed boost for the player when holding down shift. The major change was adding a limit to the speed boost itself, accompanied by UI to indicate when the player can and cannot use that boost. The color of the bar indicates the state of the speed boost functionality. 

Challenges:
My personal biggest challenge was figuring out a way to make the boost bar change in real time. After much trial and error I decided on using color change as my solution for this problem. Another challenge I faced was fixing some minor bugs regarding game logic, such as character speed and placement bugs.

Will I continue?:
I will continue to make some slight adjustments, but I intend to move on and make my own game in Unity as a form of practice. I aim to accomplish this by attending game jams as well as finding other scripting tutorials online.
